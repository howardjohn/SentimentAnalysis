Sentiment Analysis

Introduction
-----
Sentiment analysis is a statistical method that examines text data (in this project, with R) for subjective information. This is applicable in the realm of reviews, news releases, and social media, such as Twitter. In general, the goal of sentiment analysis is to determine the attitude of a speaker or writer in regards to some topic, or simply the overall polarity (positive/negative) in a set of text data. For example, we can determine if people generally like or dislike a presidential candidate or are optimistic about a certain stock.

In this project, we will obtain sets of text data by downloading a large number of tweets (mostly subjective posts/statements of 140 characters or less) from Twitter. These lists of tweets will be cleaned to remove capitalization, punctuation, digits, links, whitespace, unicode characters, and emoticons. Following this, the lists will run through functions in R counting the total number of positive, negative, and emotionally related words used throughout the tweets. This count will be translated into a sentiment score that can be used to determine a personâ€™s overall attitude. Sentiment analysis is useful in a vast array of topics; this project will focus on the 2016 Presidential Election and the LA Dodgers vs. the SF Giants.
